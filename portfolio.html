    <h2>Blown to Bits Reflection</h2>
    <p>Computing power has changed the way humans have done pretty much everything. A majority of people have access to computers, and they use them to do millions of different tasks. Computers store information, solve problems, and provide 
      entertainment and through the internet, computers can help us communicate and share information with others across the globe. Computers are even making jobs easier; they can store paperwork digitally, they can run simulations, and they 
      can calculate projected income. They are even replacing jobs in manufacturing, retail, and many other areas. The statement "computers will transform society" is incorrect in a way, since computers have already transformed society to a 
      large extent. Yet, computers are only getting better and better (especially with the advent of artificial intelligence), so computers certainly will continue to transform virtually every aspect of society.</p>

    <h2>Lightbot Reflection</h2>
    <center><img height=480 src="images/lightbotstate.png"></center>
    <p>Lightbot is a state machine, which takes in inputs and changes the output "state" based on the inputs. Computers are very much like this, in a way, since they also take in inputs that change the state
      of the computer. And since lightbot runs on a computer, it basically is a computer, so there is really nothing lightbot can do that a computer can't. However, computers are so much more than lightbot ever 
      could be. Lightbot is quite limited on the inputs that can be taken in, while a computer can take in thousands of inputs, from different key presses to mouse cursor position to even data stored on a flash
      drive. Additionally, computers have much greater functionality, with an infinite amount of possible programs to do a variety of tasks—more than just moving a robot around on a platform.</p>

    <p><u>Questions:</u><br>
      1. That way if one part fails, you know which part to fix. Alternatively, if you only checked the entire program at once, you would not know which part to fix. <br>
      2. Building a robot also requires trial and error to figure things out and make it work. Programming is similar, since there are many different parts that work together in a certain way to work; also robots require programming to run. <br>
      4. We think that the core would cycle through the "simultaneous" tasks one line at a time. That way, all of the programs would essentially be run at the same time.</p>

    <br>
    <p> <u>Questions:</u> <br>
      1. Following this naming convention would allow you to stay organized, which is especially important when you have hundreds of sprites and scripts. That way you can easily recall which message serves which purpose. <br>
      2. An event is a series of code called upon at any point. A handler is what calls different events at different times. <br>
      3. <br> 
      a. The play.G() encapsulates the action of playing the G note on the saxophone and also changing the costume of the sax sprite. <br>
      b. It would be convenient to allow the user to change which note is being played and also which instrument is used.</p>

    <h2>Scratch “Accumulator” and “Aggregator” practice <a href="//scratch.mit.edu/projects/173640171/#editor" target="_blank">See Inside</a></h2>
    <center><iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="//scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/173640171/?autostart=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
    <p><u>Questions:</u><br>
      1. The fixed variable is labeled, so you know what it represents, and if the variable is called in multiple places, you can change the variable if needed very easily rather than changing it everywhere it is used.<br>
    2.
    Most-Recent Variable: Most Recent Goal Time:</p>
<pre>Create variable recentGoal and set it to nil
  Each time a Goal is made:
    Find the difference between the last value and the second to last value of timesOfGoals.
    Set fastestGoal equal to that value
  Repeat
    </pre>

      3. <br>
      a. Video game scores, and credit balances. <br>
      b. The video game score would add the amount of points gained to the score to track the total score. <br>
      4. The accumulator keeps a running total of input values, while an aggregator stores each input value in a list. An aggregator therefore stores more information than an accumulator.</p>
