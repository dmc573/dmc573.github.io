    <h2>Blown to Bits Reflection</h2>
    <p>Computing power has changed the way humans have done pretty much everything. A majority of people have access to computers, and they use them to do millions of different tasks. Computers store information, solve problems, and provide 
    entertainment and through the internet, computers can help us communicate and share information with others across the globe. Computers are even making jobs easier; they can store paperwork digitally, they can run simulations, and they 
    can calculate projected income. They are even replacing jobs in manufacturing, retail, and many other areas. The statement "computers will transform society" is incorrect in a way, since computers have already transformed society to a 
    large extent. Yet, computers are only getting better and better (especially with the advent of artificial intelligence), so computers certainly will continue to transform virtually every aspect of society.</p>
