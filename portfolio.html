    <h2>Blown to Bits Reflection</h2>
    <p>Computing power has changed the way humans have done pretty much everything. A majority of people have access to computers, and they use them to do millions of different tasks. Computers store information, solve problems, and provide 
    entertainment and through the internet, computers can help us communicate and share information with others across the globe. Computers are even making jobs easier; they can store paperwork digitally, they can run simulations, and they 
    can calculate projected income. They are even replacing jobs in manufacturing, retail, and many other areas. The statement "computers will transform society" is incorrect in a way, since computers have already transformed society to a 
    large extent. Yet, computers are only getting better and better (especially with the advent of artificial intelligence), so computers certainly will continue to transform virtually every aspect of society.</p>

    <h2>Lightbot Reflection</h2>
    <center><img height=480 src="images/lightbotstate.png"></center>
    <p>Lightbot is a state machine, which takes in inputs and changes the output "state" based on the inputs. Computers are very much like this, in a way, since they also take in inputs that change the state
    of the computer. And since lightbot runs on a computer, it basically is a computer, so there is really nothing lightbot can do that a computer can't. However, computers are so much more than lightbot ever 
    could be. Lightbot is quite limited on the inputs that can be taken in, while a computer can take in thousands of inputs, from different key presses to mouse cursor position to even data stored on a flash
    drive. Additionally, computers have much greater functionality, with an infinite amount of possible programs to do a variety of tasksâ€”more than just moving a robot around on a platform.</p>

    <p><u>Questions:</u><br>
    1. That way if one part fails, you know which part to fix. Alternatively, if you only checked the entire program at once, you would not know which part to fix. <br>
    2. Building a robot also requires trial and error to figure things out and make it work. Programming is similar, since there are many different parts that work together in a certain way to work; also robots require programming to run. <br>
    4. We think that the core would cycle through the "simultaneous" tasks one line at a time. That way, all of the programs would essentially be run at the same time.</p>

    <p>1. Scratch broadcasts a message to all sprites. This is just how Scratch is set up as a programming language. We are using messages so that they are targeted to a particular sprite. In a large project with hundreds of sprites and scripts, explain why it might help to follow our convention that only one sprite will respond to a message and to follow our naming convention for messages.
2. Based on what you learned during this activity, explain what you think events and handlers are.
3. As computer programs get big and complicated, it is essential to manage the complexity. An important strategy for managing complexity is called encapsulation. With encapsulation some details of one part of a program are hidden from other parts of the program. In cars, for example, the details of the accelerator pedal's actions are encapsulated under the hood. As the user of the accelerator pedal, the driver only gets to press the pedal and is not encouraged to tinker with the internal mechanisms that make the pedal do what the engineer intended.

a. What are some details of the playG() method that are encapsulated by the handler?
b. A software developer can make it easier for other developers to tinker with the details of the program she is writing by exposing the details. We'll get into what this means later. For now, just consider: What details mentioned in part a might be useful to expose? In other words, what variations on playG() do you think would be convenient to allow?</p>
