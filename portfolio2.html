    <h2 id="1.2.2"><i>1.2.2</i> App Inventor Questions</h2>
    <p>Questions:<br>
    1. The Blocks section is similar to Scratch's scripts, and the Designer section is similar to Scratch's sprites. The information about 
    each object is shown in the designer area rather than the scripts area.<br>
    2. Mobile device programming will allow individuals to customize the functionality of their phone to their needs. It could allow them 
    to store, edit, and transform their own data in their own ways, and they could even program a unique game for fun.</p>
    <h2 id="1.2.3"><i>1.2.3</i> Creating Mobile Apps Questions</h2>
    <p>Questions:<br>
    1. App Inventor is similar to Scratch in that they both have click-and-drag programming to assemble the code. However, Scratch allows you 
    to program computer web games while App Inventor programs mobile apps instead. Therefore Scratch and App Inventor both have different 
    user inputs and outputs to use in programs.<br>
    2. There are different inputs that a program can implement on a phone, like the microphone, touch screen, accelerometer, etc. while a 
    computer relies on mouse and keyboard input for most programs.</p>

     <h2 id="1.3.2"><i>1.3.2</i> Variables and Functions</h2>
    <p>Questions:
    <br>1. I would like to make a program that sorts a list of data based on various criteria.
    <br>2. string vs float/int
    <br>3. The command line executes the command at that instant, and can only execute one command at a time, while the editor allows you to edit the code and then run it all at once.
    <br>4. It allows you to run multiple lines of code by only typing a few strings of code, saving time and space.</p>
    <h2 id="1.3.3"><i>1.3.3</i> Branching and Output</h2>
    <p>Questions:
    <br>1. They are the "then" parts of the code. They only get executed if the corresponding if/else boolean returns true.
    <br>2. Boolean terms: ==, <, >, <=, >=, !=, and, or, not, in, is
    <br>3. All of them are right, but Jayla's reason is the most pressing. It is better to define something only once if possible and refernce it, so you can change it if you need to in only one place.</p>
    <h2 id="1.3.4"><i>1.3.4</i> Nested Branching and Input</h2>
    <p>Questions:
    <br>1. If structures can be used to glass-box test a code to see if it functions correctly. Nested if statements allow the code to check every line of code for possible errors, and return a True value if they all work, or a false value if one part doesn't work.
    <br>2. Any number of those blocks of code could be executed based on the input. If the input triggers the wrong part of the if-else statement, it would skip a large chunk of the code.
    <br>3. A test suite tests the code to make sure every possible input generates the correct output. A programmer might make the test suite first to allow the functions to be tested as they code the program, and fix bugs along the way.</p>
    <h2 id="1.3.8"><i>1.3.8</i> Searches and Sorts</h2>
    <p>Questions:
    <br>1. Insertion is the fastest to sort a nearly-sorted list.
    <br>2. Merge sort is stable; it takes the same amount of time to sort for any list of equal size.
    <br>3. It would take at most 8 guesses if you guessed optimally.
    <br>4. An unsorted list does not allow you to know the position of an object based on other information, so you cannot search for it using that information.
    <br>5. Google definitely keeps its information indexed since it is able to gather millions of results satisfying a query in a fraction of a second.</p>
    <h2 id="1.3.10"><i>1.3.10</i> Game Theory</h2>
    <p>Questions:
    <br>1. In multiplayer video games, you make actions based on other people's actions. For example, you might choose to help or harm another player based on if they helped or harmed you. 
    Computer simulations have been used to simulate wars, stock prices, and the economy. One MIT simulation even concluded that the world economy will collapse in less than 20 years!
    <br>2. Abstraction is when a complicated process is made simpler by covering up unnecessary details. For example, the iPhone uses 
    abstraction to make it easier to use since there are less settings to worry about, but it loses functionality as a result. Abstractions 
    in code are very useful, since it makes the code more readable and easier to troubleshoot.
    <br>3. One abstraction I used is the method their_history.count('b'). This is an abstraction of a loop that will cycle through the entire 
    string their_history, but since I wanted to use it multiple times in my code, rather than coding the loop itself, I just used the method 
    to make my code easier to read and edit.</p>
    <h2 id="1.4.2"><i>1.4.2</i> Objects and Methods</h2>
    <p>Questions:
    <br>1. Absolute filenames and relative filenames both allow you to determine the directory of a particular file. Relative filenames use the directory of the current file to determine the directory of the desired file, while 
    absolute directories don't care about the current file's directory since it starts at the main index and works down from there.
    <br>2. An object is a variable with a certain class, where all the objects in its class have certain functions, or methods, assigned to it. There are default classes and custom classes that be assigned to an object.
    <br>3. A method is a function assigned to objects of a certain class. A method can be called by object.method(args) where the method will be run on that object. 
    A property is a variable assigned to objects of a certain class. The variables can be called and assigned through object.property.
    <br>4. When a method is called onto an object, the method function takes the object as the first argument, and takes in any additional arguments. The method then changes the object based on the function's code.
    </p>
    <h2 id="1.4.3"><i>1.4.3</i> Images and Arrays</h2>
    <p>Questions:
    <br>1. The data in an image contains the color values for each and every pixel in the image. This can be done using a three-dimensional array, where the three dimensions are rows, columns, and color values. The color values are typically stored as three RGB values.
    <br>2. A photograph taken with light-sensitive film uses physical matter to store the picture, and the picture quality is determined by the quality of the film rather than the number of pixels. 
    However, a digital photograph is taken with pixels using a limited amount of data, so the quality of the picture depends on the density of the pixels.
    <br>3a. The 1s and 2s place of a binary number account for 1.6% percent of the intensity, which is hardly the difference between a light blue and a slightly darker blue.
    <br>3b. 6 bits can encode 2^6, or 64, combinations, which means that it can encode the 64 numbers from 0 to 63.
    <br>3c. The image would look a bit more grainy, since solid colors would now be slightly different from pixel to pixel.
    <br>4. It would check to see how many substantially different color combinations there are within the image, differing by at least 30% or so. It would also see how many clusters of similar-colored pixels there are in the image to account for different objects with the same color.
